# Listen
Listen is a simple-as-pie bit of code enabling listening music from your server.
This was an old project of mine that I'm trying to improve now.
It's now a playing ground for sharpening my skills in angular2.

**Project not finished**

You can test it right now [here](http://nibou.eu/listen) !

### INSTALL
Listen will search for you music in the directory specified in parameters.json.
You'll have to specify also the root url to replace the path of the music directory.

npm is needed to build the project.
```
npm install
npm run gulp
```

### TODO
- add replay button
- add browsing function
- add random function
- some errors on next song sometimes
- url needs to be an url string
