Listen
======

# Project in alpha stage. A lot is going to change.

### What is Listen ?
Listen is a simple-as-pie bit of code enabling listening music from your server.
This was an old project of mine that I'm trying to improve now.
It's now a playing ground for sharpening my skills in angular2.

You can test it right now [here](http://nibou.eu/listen) !

### Installation

Listen will search for you music in the directory specified in parameters.json.  
You'll have to specify also the root url to replace the path of the music directory.  
npm is needed to build the project.
```
./install.sh
```

### TODO
- rework design (material would be great)
- add replay button
- add random function
- catch errors
- TypeError: Cannot read property 'nextElementSibling' of null
- Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH
- some errors on next song sometimes
- playlists ?
