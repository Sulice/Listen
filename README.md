# Listen
Listen is a simple-as-pie bit of code enabling listening music from your server.
This was an old project of mine that I'm trying to improve now.
It's now a playing ground for sharpening my skills in angular2.

**Project almost finished**

You can test it right now [here](http://nibou.eu/listen) !

### INSTALL
Listen will search for you music from the DATA link at the root of the project.
Just change this link to point it to your directory of choice.
```
ln -s ~/music/ DATA
```
You'll need npm to build the project.
```
npm install
npm run gulp
```
